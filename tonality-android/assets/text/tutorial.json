  welcome: "Welcome to the tonality: evolution tutorial

The grid on the right shows a seqence
of notes. Try hitting the 'Go!' button
at the bottom of the grid...",
  grid: "Great!
  
The cells in the grid can be toggled on
and off: Experiment with altering some
cells and clicking the 'Go!' button again...",
  grid-next: "Awesome!
  
Click the 'next' button below when you're
ready to continue...",
  bacterium: "This little guy is a bacterium

It's your job to fight bacteria by
sequencing their DNA. How do you do that?
Well, start by tapping the bacterium below...",
  sequence: "That melody is the bacterium's genetic code.
Can you reproduce it in the grid on the right?

Hit 'Go!' to test out your attempt, or tap the
bacterium again if you need a reminder.",
  miss: "Not bad! Keep trying...",
  hit: "You got him - good work!
  
Now you're ready for the real thing.

Note that bacteria increase their numbers
by dividing, and sometimes a mutation
causes a change in their DNA sequence.

... So you'll need to react quickly if you
want to keep the colony under control.
